            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <h2>POLLUTION CONTROL IN AUTOMOBILES</h2>
            <p>
                <li>In the final year of my graduation, we underwent a project on pollution control in automobiles.</li> 
                <li>By using water and vinegar to react with the exhaust gases pollution is controlled in the automobile exhaust gases. </li>
                <li>The main pollutants contributed by I.C. engines are CO, NOX unburned hydrocarbons (HC) and other particulate emissions. Other sources such as Electric power stations.</li>
                <li>Industrial and Domestic fuel consumers also add pollution like NOX, SO2 and particulate matters. </li>
                <li>In addition to this, all fuel burning systems emit CO2 in large quantities and this is more concerned with the Green House Effect which is going to decide the health of earth.</li>
                <li>In this project vinegar is mixed with lime stone. Reaction between vinegar and lime stone is very fast. </li>
                <li>This mixture is contacted with the exhaust gas which is emitted from the engine exhaust valve and get well mixed and due to some chemical reactions carbon dioxide are separated.</li>
                <li>As a result, the air pollution and noise pollution emitted by automobiles gets reduced.</li>
